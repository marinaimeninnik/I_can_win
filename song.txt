Take me as I am put your hand in mine now and forever
Darling here I stand, stand before you now deep inside I always knew
It was you, you and me, two hearts drawn together bound by destiny
It was you and you for me, every road leads to your door
Every step I take forever more

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I gotta lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
'Cause I can't go on, no I can't go on
I can't go on if I'm on my own

Take me as I am, put your heart in mine, stay with me forever
'Cause I am just a man who never understood, I never had a thing to prove
There was you you and me then it all came clear so suddenly
How close to you that I wanna be

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I gotta lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
'Cause I can't go on, no I can't go on
I can't go on if I'm on my own

Do you believe a love could run so stong?
Do you believe a love could pass you by?
There was no special one for me
I was the lonely one, you see
But then my heart lost all control
Now you're all that I know

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I gotta lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
'Cause I can't go on, no I can't go on

'Cause I can't go on, no I can't go on
I can't go on without somebody I could call my own
'Cause I can't go on, no I can't go on
I can't go on
